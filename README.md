## introduction


- this is a toolkit developed by Flutter, and a few of its functions can also work on MAC/Linux at present. It is dedicated to building a full-platform toolbox, hoping to integrate all the functions that can be summarized into tools with minimal code, which is also the author's initial intention.
- As a result of learning about Flutter and as a tool to constantly improve myself by writing code.

## Feature list

- common functions (open remote ADB debugging, view WIFI password, battery level camouflage, MAC address modification...)
- file manager (can run on Android/Linux/Mac at the same time file manager, has simple functions, and integration with Apktool)

- rom tools (tools that can handle Android ROM, this page is not open source)

- remote control (capable of controlling other android devices in the LAN and real-time screen projection, which is still defective)

- Niterm(a terminal emulator, created using traditional terminal ideas)

- application management (under development...)

- shadow screenshots (can generate shadow screenshots of existing screenshots, or will support screenshots with shells in the future)

- data line swiper (can swiper another android phone through the data line, the principle has been realized, but there is no time to maintain)

- nissh (similar to JuiceSSH, Windows Xshell)

##  The problem?

### 1. Why isn't it fully open source?

I didn't has so much time, except Rom pages are open source.

### 2.Why is there so much junk code in the project?

In the early stage of the project (in the first semester of the freshman year), the author wrote some junk code. Till now, the whole project has more than 1w lines of code, but there are still some early codes left, and the author did not pay attention to which parts of the code he left unintentionally.

I'll be very careful what I write next

If you see code like ```int a``` , ```Widget a``` , you can open a issue and i'll fix it.

### 3. Will I continue to maintain it?

I'll be maintaining the toolkit, fixing existing bugs, and developing new features until I get to work (two years from now), which is a huge drain on my free time. I'd appreciate it if you could contribute to the repository!



## At the last

Under the pressure of life, my time will be abnormal pressing, there are other projects need I take the time to complete, is currently the ordinary university sophomore, so the school also will give me a lot of time overhead, the development of the toolkit also paid a lot of time in my university, although the optimized place too much, but I still will be open source, hope there is place for everyone to use, some of which I have the optimization of the existing problems, hope after I can spare more time to optimize.
